# Currency-Converter-Project 
This project is a currency converter. The converter calls CoinGecko's "exchange_rates" API in order to provide the user with up-to-date currency 
conversions. The information is delivered by navigating through a GUI constructed through Tkinter frameworks. 

More information on CoinGecko's API can be found here: https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation 

## How to use 
To use this project, simply clone the git repository to your device and run the main.py file. When you are selecting the currencies you wish to convert to and 
from, click on the drop-down menu and select your desired currency. Once it has been selected, press "Continue".
